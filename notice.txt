NOTICE

This repository includes original research and code related to the Coherence Quotient Q(t),
a spectral alignment diagnostic applied to turbulence and singularity detection in fluid systems.

While the source code is provided under the MIT License (see LICENSE.txt), the theoretical
framework, use cases, and scientific interpretation of Q(t) are part of an ongoing
research program by the author.

This work is shared for **educational and research purposes only**.

⚠️ Commercial use of the underlying methods, structural interpretations, or predictive
claims is **not authorized** without prior permission or formal agreement.

The dataset used (HRRR) is public and accessed via the Herbie Main interface.
All Q(t) results in this repository are derived directly from that data and are 
presented to demonstrate proof-of-concept only — not as an operational forecasting tool.

For academic reuse, attribution is required.
