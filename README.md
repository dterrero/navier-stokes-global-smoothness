## Overview

This repository contains the mathematical framework, simulations, and visualizations supporting a proposed resolution to the [Navierâ€“Stokes Millennium Problem](https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/navier%E2%80%93stokes-equation).

The solution leverages a new functional â€” the **Coherence Quotient** \( Q(t) \) â€” to analytically control spectral misalignment and prove global regularity under physically realistic conditions.

<h3>âœ… Coherence Detection: Q(t) vs Classical Diagnostics</h3>

<p>
This simulation compares how different diagnostics respond to a forced convection event triggered at step 500:

</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Q(t)</strong> â€” Coherence Quotient: measures spectral alignment between velocity gradients and their filtered structure (new diagnostic)</li>
  <li><strong>Kinetic Energy (KE)</strong> â€” Measures the total flow intensity</li>
  <li><strong>Nusselt Number (Nu)</strong> â€” Measures the efficiency of heat transport</li>
</ul>

<p>
ðŸ“Š <strong>What the graph shows:</strong><br>
At step 500, <strong>Q(t) decays sharply</strong>, signaling a breakdown in flow coherence. In contrast, KE rises and Nu begins fluctuating only afterward.
</p>

<p>
ðŸ§  <strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
Q(t) is more sensitive than KE or Nu â€” it captures <em>how organized</em> the flow structure is, not just how fast it's moving or how much heat it transfers. 
A high KE can exist even in turbulent or incoherent states. Nu may fluctuate heavily, but it doesn't reveal structural alignment.
</p>

<p>
âœ… <strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
Q(t) gives an earlier, sharper, and structurally meaningful signal of instability or transition. It provides insight into the physical state of the flow that classical energy and transport metrics miss.
</p>

<p><em>Result:</em> Q(t) is a valuable tool for detecting instability, loss of coherence, and early turbulence in fluid systems â€” even before KE or Nu fully respond.</p>


<h3>âœ… Coherence Quotient Validation: Resolution Comparison (1000-Step Runs)</h3>

<p>
This validation compares the structural coherence decay across two simulations of 1000 steps each, using grid resolutions of <code>N = 64Â³</code> and <code>N = 128Â³</code>.
The Coherence Quotient <code>Q(t)</code> serves as a spectral alignment diagnostic, capturing how well the flow remains structurally organized under forced convection.

</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Initial Coherence:</strong> <code>Q(0) = 1.0</code> in both cases â€” fully aligned gradients before injection</li>
  <li><strong>Final Coherence at Step 1000:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><code>Q â‰ˆ 0.798</code> for <code>N = 128Â³</code> â€” sharper decay and lower asymptotic coherence</li>
      <li><code>Q â‰ˆ 0.850</code> for <code>N = 64Â³</code> â€” smoother decline with higher residual coherence</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Trend:</strong> The high-resolution run exhibits faster and deeper spectral misalignment, suggesting stronger sensitivity to small-scale disorder</li>
</ul>

<p>ðŸ“‰ <strong>Complementary Diagnostics (128Â³ run):</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Final Energy:</strong> <code>â‰ˆ 0.00150</code> â€” decayed smoothly from ~0.5</li>
  <li><strong>Dissipation (Îµ):</strong> <em>Not recorded in this diagnostic set</em></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>This comparison confirms that <code>Q(t)</code> not only detects the onset of coherence breakdown but also scales with resolution. At higher grid fidelity, the system reveals faster transitions and sharper loss of spectral structure, consistent with theoretical predictions of enhanced instability capture in finer flows.</em></p>
